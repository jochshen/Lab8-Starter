Graceful degradation and service workers are related in that in graceful degradation, you start out with a full-fleshed application and eventually 'address lower levels with grace' per the lab. Similarly, service workers also help to ensure that a web application remains functional even when advanced features are unavaliable. Service workers can be interpreted as an example of graceful degradation that aims to help ensure that users can access essential features of a web application.
